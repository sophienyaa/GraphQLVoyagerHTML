# GraphQL Voyager HTML

A simple HTML page that renders GraphQL Voyager to visualise Skedulo schema.

This is based on the example provided [here](https://github.com/IvanGoncharov/graphql-voyager/tree/main/example), customised to retrieve the Schema from your Skedulo tenant. This is intended to be run locally.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository, and on line `50` replace `<token here>` with your Skedulo API token. 
3. Open the `index.html` in your browser of choice!

NOTE: This page uses the versions of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/IvanGoncharov/graphql-voyager) from the [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) CDN.
